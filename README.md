Just saw Until Dawn. My god, wasn’t quite ready for that. I’m still buzzing, the way too much caffeine hits you or when you accidentally stand too close to a speaker at a concert. The theater was 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zing. Couldn’t concentrate on the previews but that   just GRABBED me like a cat falling from a tree wraps around a branch not to die?? Haha.

The cinematography — chef's kiss — it was like each shot was hungrily chewed on and spit out for us to make garlands from. The way night cloaked everything, that flicker of dawn feeling like a distant whisper, you know? Like the sun is a shy guest at a party it wasn’t invited to. Dude beside me munching on popcorn like he’s never seen food, crumbs are still glued to me like overly committed friendships. Oh and the sounds! Echoing whispers, feel like echoes of that ENNEAD presentation gone horribly wrong. The whispers were just shadows, did you catch that? Or is my imagination doing yoga again?

> Every twist was a twistier twist than my spine right now, had to twist this way, twist that way in these seats crafted by sadistic little gremlins. Plot was a pretzel being drawn by a child, I mean, who'd have guessed the janitor was the mastermind all this time? Won’t spoil but seriously, you’ve got to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   — dad asked if I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for the home theater setup thing. Characters flitting across the screen like moths around a broken headlamp, unpredictable, almost irritatingly irresistible.

All those moving pieces felt like testing the patience of atomic particles before they explode maybe?? Gosh, the shades of blue, blues so deep you could lose your keys there. 

rushed through the doors of the cinema, jostling crowds and elbows, hearts fluttering like playful shadows under a streetlamp, scratched some weird dark circle drawings beside me, thought they had some curse engraved,,,,,never mind they were just normal doodles.

The dialogue? At one point couldn’t stop hearing it bounce around in my head — the cadence matched the beating of my heart. Thrill/mysterious, hair on my neck doing a little jig.

Wait… margarine drop! That’s what I’m calling what just happened with THAT scene, cue the messy floor and slippery secrets sliding away from mere mortals. Seriously dude, don’t sleep on this one.

function untilMorning() {
   const promises = [‘sunrise’];
   for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
      if (arguments[i] != ‘sunrise’) {
         promises.push(‘?`);
      }
   }
   return promises;
}
